Data File Below

Ramblings that need to be noted carefully.

* This assignment has two parts, one is to build the desired data structure from the list.txt provided and another one is to perform search in that dictionary.
* All kinds of data structures need to be defined with logical names, certainly not like node, node123, mynode11 etc. the same thing applies to function definition and variables too.
* More credits where the search returns in a highly optimized way.
* More credits where the developer writes the Space as well-Run Time Complexity of the code at the desired places.
* More Credit where the developer handles the relevant corner cases.
* EXTRA glory credits if there is a spelling mistake in search, the code returns the suggested words.
